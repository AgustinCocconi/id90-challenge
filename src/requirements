These are the requirements of the challenge:
We ask you to build a frontend in Angular for the development of the test.
We ask you to apply all the best practices and principles you consider necessary (software design patterns, SOLID principles, etc.) to implement readable, scalable, and well-organized code.
We ask you to design an attractive, modern, and user-friendly interface for the application.
Make sure that the designed application is responsive and adapts to different screen sizes.
IMPORTANT: We ask you to create something personal and different from how it is currently done at ID90Travel. Please use your creativity.
If possible, We would like you to use redux for state management in the application.
